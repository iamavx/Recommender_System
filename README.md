Recommender System :- A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users.

The objective of recommender systems is to provide recommendations based on recorded information on the users' preferences. These systems use information filtering techniques to process information and provide the user with potentially more relevant items.

I am going to present content based recommender System that uses the text vectorisation ( text is going to convert into vector) technique like Bag of word where we cocatenate all the tags of moviessothatwecangetmost commonwordsbyusingthemweformamatrixandbyusingthe cosine Similarity technique we can find the similar movie.
